# Image Classification - Cifar-10

<p> In this project I built my own Neural Network in order to classify the images of Cifar-10 dataset.</p>
<p> I created 8 Neural Networks in total, but CNN7 was the best one. </p>
<p> Also CNN7 managed to count with overfitting/ underfitting and tested in a binary dataset as well. In both cases CNN7 achieved very well results. </p>
